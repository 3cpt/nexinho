# nexinho

nexinho is a Discord bot that born from an idea generated by a group of friends to make people interact in the channel. The bot is supposed to be used in private channels

Uses:
* [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus) - library for making bots using the Discord API
* MongoDB - for data persistence (free MongoDB Atlas tier)

## Commands

**Word game (*in portuguese*)** - A game where discord users tries to guess the word

* `!word` - shows the current word
* `!word <word>` - submit a guess
* `!ranking` - shows the top three users
* `!add <word>` - **WARNING** adds a new word to the repository (should be used in a private message with the Bot to avoid spoiler)


## Future Features

* Use `!add` based on roles
* Specify the channel to avoid spam

## Usage

* Clone this repo
* Configure the `DiscordToken` and the `MongoConnection` connection string in the `appsettings.json` file
* Build the solution - `dotnet build -c Release` in the root folder
* Execute the Nexinho.dll - `dotnet Nexinho.dll`
